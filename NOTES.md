# triage-util Notes

## PR Triage

It would be nice to have some CLI tooling to help with the PR triage procedure.
According to <https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/triage-procedure.html>, we
mostly deal with three kinds of status labels: `S-waiting-on-review`,
`S-waiting-on-author` and `S-blocked`.

The thinking is, allow the tool to help collect links or PR numbers fulfilling
the relevant critera via GitHub API, which will be dumped to some kind of
template TOML file awaiting the triage team member to fill in as they are
guided to perform PR triage actions.

### `S-waiting-on-review`

Link:
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3AS-waiting-on-review+-label%3AI-nominated+-label%3Aneeds-fcp>

- Only triage PRs that were last updated 15 days or more ago (give or take a
  day).
- For each PR:
    - If the PR has new conflicts, CI failed, or a new review has been made
      then:
        - Change the label to `S-waiting-on-author`.
        - Ping the author.
    - Add PR to triage to report.

### `S-waiting-on-author`

Link:
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3AS-waiting-on-author+-label%3AI-nominated+-label%3Aneeds-fcp>

- Only triage PRs that were last updated 15 days or more ago (give or take a
  day).
- For each PR:
    - If the author did what the PR was waiting on them for then update the
      label to `S-waiting-on-review`.
    - Otherwise, if the author still needs to do something, then ping the
      author if they are **not** a member of a Rust team (does not include
      working groups â€” only teams like `T-compiler`, `T-lang`, `T-rustdoc`,
      etc.).
    - Add PR triage to report.

### `S-blocked`

Link: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3AS-blocked+sort%3Aupdated-asc>

- For each PR:
    - If it is still blocked then leave it as-is.
    - Otherwise, if it is no longer blocked, then remove `S-blocked` (and add a
      status label like `S-waiting-on-review` if appropriate).
    - Add PR triage to report.

## Issue Triage

A contributor might not have permission to directly assign labels to an issue
via the github UI. It can be helpful to have some kind of GUI/TUI for label
management -- that is, the user can manage labels via the GUI/TUI and then
the corresponding `rustbot` command could be generated, e.g.

```
@rustbot label +T-compiler +C-bug +A-linkage +O-macos -needs-triage
```

It would be especially nice to validate that these labels exist before posting
a comment, that the `rustbot` command is at least syntactically valid.

For valid labels, see e.g.
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/a84bb95a1f65bfe25038f188763a18e096a86ab2/triagebot.toml#L4>.
